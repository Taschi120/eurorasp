# About

This program is intended for those wishing to use a Raspberry Pi as a MIDI input for a eurorack synthesizer (or similar formats). My motivation for using a Raspberry, rather than something Atmel-based (Arduino or similar), is that a) i want support for USB devices and b) i want to have some features like a trigger, gate, note speed and some more nice things like that, which exceed the usual ATtiny85-based designs floating around the internet.

My goal is for this repo to include the software, along with schematics for the required circuitry and config files for setting up Raspbian properly for embedded use.

Note that this software is not currently finished or fully functional.

# Building

Make sure to install the following tools and libraries on your Raspberry:

* gcc and g++
* make
* libgpiod (including dev packages)
* alsa
* asound (including dev packages)
* pthread (including dev packages)

Alsa, asound and pthread can be replaced with Jack but I have not personally tested that. Those dependencies are required by RtMidi and further info can be found on RtMidi's website at https://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtmidi/.

Obtain a copy of the source code (via git clone or download), navigate into the project root folder and run "make".

No "make install" step is currently provided.
